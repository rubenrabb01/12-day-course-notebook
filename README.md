# Python on creating an App 

In this notebook I capture my work with Python in handling Pandas data frames, simplejson for web scraping, plots using Bokeh, etc. 
The code shown here describes the steps taken to a Flask app that worked with Python through the command console. 
The app itself was deployed to Heroku and it is currently active (**paste link here**). It carries out request calls to the API from Quandle WIKI dataset oh stock ticker prices and create plots of last month' inputs.
