# 12-day-course-notebook

Notebook on my work with Python for handling Pandas data frames, simplejson for web scraping, plots using Bokeh, etc. 
The code hosted here describes the steps taken to make it work a Flask app using Python through the command console. 
The app itself was deployed to Heroku and it is currently active (**paste link here**). It carries out request calls to the API from Quandle WIKI dataset oh stock ticker prices for creating plots of last month' inputs.
